INSURANCE CLAIM PREDICTION This repository contains code to predict the insurance claim based on the given parameters. With the help of this project a company can detect the insurance claims and can decide weather to give insurance or not.

DESCRIPTION Predictive analytics, according to more than two thirds of insurance companies, has helped them lower costs and trouble with underwriting. With the development of artificial intelligence, insurance companies are using machine learning more and more to accomplish important goals including cost cutting, improved underwriting, and fraud detection. Insurance companies, in particular, can screen cases quickly, accurately assess them, and estimate costs using machine learning. This data emphasises how crucial it is for every insurance company to utilise machine learning. The likelihood of an insurance claim gives insurance firms an easy way to forecast their own profit and loss.By doing this, they can also make decisions about how to give insurance to their clients based on factors like age, past health issues, whether or not the client smokes, the client's BMI, and how many people reside in the client's home. Moreover, businesses can record the gender of the insured individuals. This probability machine can compute the cost that should be paid by the individual in the event of an emergency if all these facts are given to the company. Machine learning will be used to deliver detailed solutions to all of these issues and questions.
